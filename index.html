                <p class="description">
                    The web connects our society, providing enormous opportunities for changing and improving how we live every day from sharing information to interacting with others. We have witnessed the power of the web through a variety of web-based applications, including social media apps like Instagram and Twitter, productivity apps like Google Docs and Slack, as well as transportation apps like Uber and Lyft. These apps are now deeply emersed in our everyday lives and drastically changed how we communicate, work and move in recent years. 
                    <br><br>
                    In this course, students will learn how to develop responsive and interactive web applications. We begin by learning basics including HTML, CSS, Javascript, as well as advanced client-side frameworks such as Material-UI and React.js. We will also briefly touch on server-side issues including a web server (Node.js), data storages (Web Storage, MongoDB, and Firebase), and asynchronous communication between a client and a server. The course will culminate with a final project where students take a human-centered design approach to address the need of people by building a sophisticated web application.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Laptop policy</strong><br>
                        Bring laptops to all class meetings. However, students may not use laptops, tablets, phones or other electronic devices during lectures, especially in guest lectures, unless explicitly asked to do so.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Attendance</strong><br>
                        Attendance is not tracked but you may miss critical tips and advice for completing assignments. You may end up spending much more time if you tackle the assignments alone. Also, interacting and practicing with your peers is a critical part of your learning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Late submission policy</strong><br>
                        10 % of the total possible points will be automatically deducted per each late day. The lowest grade possible is set to 60%.
                        <br><br>
                        <em>Example:</em> <br>
                        If you submit 8 days late to an assignment worth 10 points, your grade would be 2 points if you were awarded full credit on the assignment (8 days late x 1 point deducted per day = 8 point late Penalty). However, based on the 60% lowest grade possible, your grade will be adjusted to 6 points.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Regrade policy</strong><br>
                        Fair and transparent grading is important. Please contact us know if you think there is an error or unreasonable deduction in your assignment. Only regrading requests within 7 days after the initial grade are accepted.
